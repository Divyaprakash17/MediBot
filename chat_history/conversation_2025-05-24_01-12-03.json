ASSESSMENT:**\n\n* **Possible Conditions:**  A fever can be a symptom of many conditions, ranging from mild viral infections (like the common cold or flu) to more serious bacterial infections (like pneumonia or urinary tract infections), or other illnesses.  It could also be related to medication side effects or other underlying health issues.  It is impossible to determine the cause based solely on the presence of a fever.\n\n* **Level of Urgency:**  This depends entirely on the severity and duration of the fever, as well as the presence of other symptoms.  At this point, the urgency is considered **urgent care**.  Further information is needed to accurately assess the situation.\n\n\n**3. RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n* **Immediate Next Steps:**\n    * **Measure your temperature:** Use a thermometer to accurately determine the temperature.\n    * **Monitor your symptoms:** Pay close attention to any other symptoms you may be experiencing, such as chills, body aches, cough, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, or rash.  Note the onset and severity of these symptoms.\n    * **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\n    * **Rest:** Get plenty of rest.\n\n* **When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n    * **Fever above"
