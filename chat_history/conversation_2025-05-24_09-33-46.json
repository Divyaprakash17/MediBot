ASSESSMENT:**\n\n* **Possible Conditions:**  A fever can be a symptom of many conditions, ranging from mild viral infections (like the common cold or flu) to more serious bacterial infections (like pneumonia or urinary tract infections), or even less common causes.  It's impossible to determine the cause based solely on the presence of a fever.\n\n* **Level of Urgency:**  Given the limited information, the urgency is currently **unclear**.  Further assessment is necessary to determine the severity.\n\n**3. RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n* **Immediate Next Steps:**\n    * **Measure the temperature:** Use a thermometer to accurately determine the temperature.  Record the reading.\n    * **Monitor other symptoms:**  Pay attention to any other symptoms developing, such as cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, rash, or changes in mental status.  Note the onset and severity of any additional symptoms.\n    * **Hydration:**  Increase fluid intake to prevent dehydration.\n\n* **When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n    * **Fever over 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C) in adults or 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) in infants:**  High fevers"
